# Input
firstNum = input("Enter first number:")
secondNum = input("Enter second number:")
firstNum = int(firstNum)
secondNum = int(secondNum)
# Operation
addition = firstNum + secondNum
diff = firstNum - secondNum
multiply = firstNum * secondNum
divison = firstNum / secondNum
# Output
print("Addition ", addition)
print("Substraction ", diff)
print("Multiplication ", multiply)
print("Division ", divison)
